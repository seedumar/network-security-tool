Network Security Tool

📌 Project Overview

This project is a Network Security Tool that helps in:

✅ Scanning active devices on the network
✅ Detecting open ports
✅ Monitoring network traffic
✅ Identifying potential vulnerabilities

🛠️ Technologies Used

We will use Python with the following libraries:

Scapy – for network packet analysis

Socket – for scanning open ports

Nmap – for advanced network scanning

Psutil – for monitoring network usage

📥 Installation

🚀 Features & Usage

1. Scan Active Devices on Network

python network_security_tool.py -s

This will list all devices connected to the network.

2. Scan Open Ports on a Target Device

python network_security_tool.py -p 192.168.1.10

Replace 192.168.1.10 with the target IP to check for open ports.

3. Monitor Network Traffic
